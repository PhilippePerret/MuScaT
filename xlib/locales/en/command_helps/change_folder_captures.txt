This script lets you define the folder which will hold the screen
shots.

USAGE
-----
  #{'./change_folder_captures.rb[ ./path/to/folder][ options][-h]'.jaune}

  The `path/to/folder` path becomes the receiver of all
  captures. If not provided, the default folder (desktop), is
  used.

OPTIONS
-------

  #{'-mk'.jaune}
      The folder will be built if it doesn't exist.

  #{'-h'.jaune} or #{'--help'.jaune}
      To display this help.

TIP
---

  To set the path, you can simply drag and drop the folder on the
  Terminal window, juste after `./utils/change_folder_captures.rbÂ `.
  Don't forget the space at the end before dragging.

EXAMPLES
--------

  #{'> cd /Users/athome/Programs/MuScaT
  > ./utils/change_folder_captures.rb /Users/athome/Music/Analysis/ -mk'.jaune}

      The `~/Music/Analysis` folder becomes the folder where
      captures will be saved.
      The folder is built if it doesn't exist (option `-mk`).

  #{'> ./utils/change_folder_captures.rb'.jaune}

      The captures folder is reset to its default value (Desktop).

  #{'> ./utils/change_folder_captures.rb -h'.jaune}

      Display this help.
