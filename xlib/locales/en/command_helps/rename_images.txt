[UGLY ENGLISH TRANSLATION TO IMPROVE]

This script lets you rename all the image files in a folder from
1 to 1 starting with 0.

USAGE
-----
  #{'./utils/rename_images.rb <path/to/folder>[ <affixe>][ <sort key>]'.jaune}

  #{'path/to/folder'} is the relative or absolute path up to the
  images folder.

  The #{'`<affixe>`'.jaune} is the name without extname. For instance,
  if affixe is set to 'my-image', image files will rename like:
  'my-image-0.png', 'my-image-1.png', 'my-image-2.png', etc.
  The extname depends on original file.

  If the #{'<sort key>'.jaune} is set to `-name`, files are sorted by
  their name rather by their creation date (default).

TIP
---

  You can get easily the path/to/folder: type `./utils/rename_images.rbÂ `
  (with a space at the end) and drag and drop the folder from your
  Finder to the Terminal Window (or your console).

EXAMPLES
--------

  #{'> cd /Users/athome/Programs/MuScaT
  > ./utils/rename_images.rb /Users/athome/Music/Analysis/myLastAnalysis/images'.jaune}

      All images of `myLastAnalysis/images` folder will be renamed
      in "image-X.png" in the creation date order.

  #{'> dMuscat="/Users/athome/Programs/MuScaT"
  > dImages="/Users/athome/Music/Analysis/Mozart/Sonate/images"
  > cd $dMuscat
  > ./utils/rename_images.rb $dImages mozart-sonata -name'.jaune}

      All of the files of `Sonate/images` folder will be renamed
      in "mozart-sonata-X.jpg" in the name order.

      Note the second parameter ("mozart-sonata") which sets the
      "affixe" of the names and the third parameter ("-name") which
      modify the sort key.

      Above, we used variables (`dMuscat`, 'dImages') for
      convenience. They could be defined in your bash profile
      to be used anywhere.
